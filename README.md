Abstract

In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based method to forecast the results of endgames in chess between King-Rook and King-Pawn (KRKP). We investigate the performance of Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression algorithms in predicting win or loss outcomes for the first player using a dataset of 3,196 positions. We identify the optimal algorithm by analyzing exploratory data, encoding features, and evaluating the model in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. With a 100% accuracy rate, the Decision Tree model performs exceptionally well; however, a score this perfect calls for careful consideration to rule out overfitting. Conversely, the results from the Random Forest and Logistic Regression models are encouraging, highlighting the value of probabilistic and ensemble methods in challenging classification problems. Our results show that the Decision Tree algorithm is the best model; however, we also recommend additional testing to make sure the results are reliable and can be applied to a wider variety of endgames in chess.
